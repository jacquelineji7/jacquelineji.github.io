        <h3>Hi! Jackie here!</h3>
        <p>I am a digital arts student at the University of Waterloo Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business</p>
        <p>After adapting to the mindset of always think from the users’ perspective, I found the way I see the world completely changed. I started to feel more empathy towards not just the users, but everyone around me. I was able to connect with people better, and as a result, I feel happier. </p>

        <p>I was always into the design, however, I didn't go to an Art school for I felt my art lacks meaning. Unlike most artists, I simply wanted to make things look pretty. I was also into computer programming and psychology. After I learned about UI/UX, it is the first time I feel like I meant it when I say I'm passionate about design. </p>

        <p>The more I learned the field of human-centered design, the more I realized there are just so much more to learn. I'm really grateful that I get to do what I love every day and see myself improving.</p>

        <p>My goal is to be able to create products that bring joy to people and make people feel more connected with each other. </p>
