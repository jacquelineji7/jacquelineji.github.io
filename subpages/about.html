        <h3>Hi! Jackie here!</h3>
        <p>I am a digital arts student at the University of Waterloo Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business.</p>
        <p>After adapting to the mindset of always think from the users’ perspective, I found the way I see the world completely changed. I started to feel more empathy towards not just the users, but everyone around me. I was able to connect with people better, and as a result, I feel happier. </p>

        <p>The more I dived into the field of human-centered design, the more I realized there are just so much more to learn. I'm grateful to be in a degree that teaches what I want to learn and get to do what I'm passionate about every day.</p>

        <p>My goal is to be able to create products that bring joy to people and make people feel more connected with each other. </p>
        <p>I’m currently in search for an exciting internship for May to August 2020!</p>
