        <p>I am a digital arts student at the University of Waterloo Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business.</p>


        <p> I'm obsessed with tea and coffee. A Kung Fu Tea set was the first thing I put in my luggage when I first came to Canada in 2014. </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in China and moved to Canada at the age of 15. My background allows me to have different perspectives when it comes to UX. E-commerce in particular, the way it works in Asia is significantly different from the western world, which resulted in differences in browsing habits and layout preferences. Cultural difference is an area that I’m passionate about.  </p>

        <p>When it comes to UI/UX, I am most interested in material design. Additionally, the instant feedback to users' action is also an area that I'm curious about. In particular, the kind of visual feedback that would improve the overall flow of the user experience. </p>

        <p>My goal is to create interactive interface without distracting users from the actual content, and interface that makes users feel smart and in control when navigating through. </p>
        <p>I’m currently in search for an exciting internship for May to August 2020!</p>

        <p>Did I mention how much I love coffee? Nothing makes me happier than a pretty latte art! </p>
