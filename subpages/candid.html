          <h3>What problems are we trying to solve?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Technology is being blamed for making people lonelier. We wanted to change this by focusing one specific thing that people do. Taking photos to post on social media when hanging out with friends. We want to create an AI camera that detected the best shots and take it for users, and therefore encourages the user to put their phones down can talk people with their full attention. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section2">
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We believe having meaningful conversation with people and feeling connected are the keys to happiniess. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section3">
          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Position your phone to be facing where the crowd is and press start. Come back in 20 minutes and you will see 9 best moments that the camera had captured for you. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section4">
          <h3>What did I learned from this project</h3>
          <p>We started with making it an app that whenever a smile is detected using Microsoft Azure Face, it triggers the shutter button. We had a lot of fun building and testing the app as all of us would have to smile at the camera to test if it works. Unfortunately our app didn't quite work at the end due to time constraint. This is more of an experimental project we did and it teached me a lot about what makes a good team player.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section-next">
          <h3>What's next</h3>
          <p>We decided to build an app due to some technical and time constraints. But we thought this would work better as an additional feature on social media platform. This can also make capturing photos easier for people with disabilities. </p>
