          <h3>What problems are we trying to solve?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Non-profits have no access to talents due to the lack of sufficient funds and resources</li>
            <li>2. Students that try to break into industries with no working experience</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section2">
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Being someone who is both the creator of this product and the targeted users, I understand the struggle we have as students that try to seek opportunities that help us learn and grow. Meanwhile finding a team with responsible people is already hard enough. We have also talked to non-profits and they express their biggest struggle is not having enough of money to hire people. </li>
            <li>We want to create a sustainable cycle between professional and social development by building a global community of non-profits and students</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section3">
          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Upper year students help non-profits analyze problems, bottlenecks and come up with solution</li>
            <li>2. Upper-year students with project managment experience help break down solutions into small projects</li>
            <li>3. Group of students execute projects under the supervison of a student project manager</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="section4">
          <h3>Why the 3 steps?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The first step is made to help non-profits look for solutions. We talked to numerous non-profits and they don't tend to know what kind of position to hire and what kind of projects to post. We aimed to make the platform more accessible through making sure there is a person that assists them through the whole process</li>
            <li>A project manager is essential to make sure the deadlines and met and the team is comunicating well with the non-profits.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section5">
          <h3>Other design decisions?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>- The sample project section is prioritize as it shows the type of projects students would be working on. I used different colours for the category tags as it helped the student establish the association of colours with the category, which make it easier for the users to browse the projects based off the categories</li>
            <li>- In the mobile verson I took out the right button and replaced with the dots indicating it can be swipe to the left for more projects.  </li>
          </ul>
